Adds the ETag, Last-Modified, Expires and Cache-Control headers to HTTP responses generated by WordPress to facilitate caching.


== Description ==

Adds the *ETag*, *Last-Modified*, *Expires* and *Cache-Control* headers to HTTP responses generated by WordPress to facilitate caching.

These HTTP headers are sent to the client when visiting the page of a
post, page, attachment, custom post type, the front page (static pages are supported)
or a page of a category, tag, author or date based archive (pagination is supported).
Also, multi-page content is supported.

The value of each header is based on information provided by the post object
in each of the above pages.

In case of archives, the first post is used in order to determine the time
the archive was last modified. Special consideration has been taken so that
ETags are unique, even if a post appears first in more than one archives.

Currently, the HTTP headers above are not sent for feeds and pages containing
search results. This is in the TODO list. Suggestions are welcome.

By default, the expiration date of each page is set to one day after the time
the client accessed the resource, but this is configurable (see *configuration* section).

= Configuration =

The plugin can be configured by filtering the options array. You can add a
filtering function like the following in the `functions.php` file of your theme:

`
function addh_custom_options ( $options ) {
    // These are the default options.
    return array_merge( $options, array(
        'add_etag_header' => true,
        'generate_weak_etag' => false,
        'add_last_modified_header' => true,
        'add_expires_header' => true,
        'add_cache_control_header' => true,
        'cache_max_age_seconds' => 86400,
    ) );
}
add_filter( 'addh_options', 'addh_custom_options', 10, 1 );
`

The options should be self-explanatory.

= Available Filters =

The following filters can be used to further customize the HTTP headers.

`addh_options` - applied to the plugin options array. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of options. See the example in the *configuration* section above.
`addh_cache_control_header_format` - applied to the template that is used to generate the `Cache-Control` header's value. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: a string. The default template is "`public, max-age=%s`". The template must have one `%s` placeholder for the max-age seconds.
`addh_headers` - applied to all HTTP headers that have been generated by Add-Headers before they are sent to the client. The hooked function should accept and return 1 argument: an array of HTTP headers (strings).

= Testing =

You can use [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) in order to check the headers.

For example:

`
curl -I -L http://example.org/sample-page/
curl -I -L -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate" http://example.org/sample-page/
`

Pull requests are welcome.

= If you use Varnish =

If you use Varnish, try the [WPVM plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpvm/ "WordPress Varnish Modified plugin homepage") 
to purge pages either automatically as they are updated or on demand.
